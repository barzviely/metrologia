# AWS EKS Migration: From Cluster Autoscaler to Karpenter Guide

**Transform your Kubernetes infrastructure for better performance and up to 50% cost savings**

Many organizations using Amazon EKS still rely on Cluster Autoscaler, which often leads to over-provisioning and rising infrastructure costs. This guide walks you through a zero-downtime migration to Karpenter, a smarter and more efficient autoscaler for Kubernetes.

## Why Migrate to Karpenter?

Many organizations running Kubernetes on Amazon EKS rely on Cluster Autoscaler (CA) to manage node scaling. While CA is a proven tool, it often results in underutilized infrastructure, slower scaling, and higher costs.

Here's why migrating to Karpenter is a game changer:

**Faster Scaling**  
Karpenter provisions new nodes in 60–90 seconds, compared to 3–5 minutes with Cluster Autoscaler.

**Intelligent Instance Selection**  
Automatically chooses the most cost-effective and performance-optimized instance types, including support for Spot Instances.

**Cost Optimization**  
By leveraging Spot capacity and better bin-packing, Karpenter helps cut infrastructure costs by 40–60%.

**Improved Resource Utilization**  
Smarter scheduling = fewer idle resources and better cluster efficiency.

In most environments, switching to Karpenter results in:

- 50% fewer nodes  
- 2x+ faster scaling  
- Much higher Spot utilization  
- Lower cloud bills

### What's Wrong with Cluster Autoscaler?

Cluster Autoscaler works, but with limitations:

- Relies on Auto Scaling Groups (ASGs) with predefined instance types  
- Adds nodes slowly, reacting to unschedulable pods  
- Doesn't support Spot capacity natively  
- Leads to over-provisioned clusters and wasted costs

## Pre-Migration Assessment

Before making any infrastructure changes, it's critical to understand the current state of your EKS cluster. A successful migration to Karpenter starts with identifying inefficiencies and uncovering opportunities for optimization.

### Step 1: Analyze Your Current State

**What to check:**

- **Cluster resource usage**  
  Review total node count, CPU and memory utilization across your workloads.

- **Application requests vs. actual usage**  
  Most apps request more CPU/memory than needed, leading to inefficiency.

- **Instance type efficiency**  
  Assess if current instance types fit your workload characteristics.

- **Scaling behavior**  
  Look at how long scaling takes and how well it matches demand.

- **Cost visibility**  
  Identify high-cost patterns or unused capacity.

**Tools to use:**

- Kubernetes Resource Recommender (KRR)  
- CloudWatch Metrics  
- AWS Cost Explorer or CUR

**Common findings:**

- 2–3x over-provisioned CPU/memory  
- Node utilization < 20%  
- Cost dominated by on-demand instances  
- Cluster Autoscaler too slow to meet demand

---

## Phase 1: Resource Optimization

### Step 2: Right-Size Your Applications

**Key optimizations:**

- **Health checks**  
  Add readiness, liveness, and startup probes.

- **High availability**  
  Use multiple replicas and appropriate autoscaling metrics.

- **Resource right-sizing**  
  Apply KRR recommendations, test changes gradually.

- **PodDisruptionBudgets (PDBs)**  
  Temporarily relax constraints to allow node consolidation.

### Step 3: Deploy and Validate Changes

Apply and test in dev/staging before production.

**Expected results:**

- Node count reduction: 40–60%  
- Cluster utilization increase: from ~15% to 40%+  
- Same performance, lower cost

---

## Phase 2: Deploy Karpenter

### Step 4: Prepare Infrastructure

**Requirements:**

- Tagged subnets and security groups  
- IAM role with EC2 permissions  
- Proper VPC configuration

**Deployment strategy:**

- Run Karpenter alongside Cluster Autoscaler  
- Use Helm or Terraform  
- Karpenter nodes outside ASGs

**NodePool/Provisioner setup:**

- Define instance types, capacity types, zones  
- Enable consolidation  
- Separate general and critical workloads

---

## Phase 3: Controlled Migration

### Step 5: Implement Node Affinity Strategy

**Two-tier node strategy:**

- **Critical infrastructure → On-demand nodes**  
- **Application workloads → Spot or mixed capacity**

Use `nodeAffinity` rules and labels to direct workloads.

### Step 6: Execute Gradual Migration

**Migration approaches:**

- **Option 1: Natural migration**  
  Let workloads reschedule slowly.

- **Option 2: Rolling restart**  
  Force redeployments with zero downtime.

**Monitor during migration:**

- Pod placement  
- App performance  
- Spot interruptions and rescheduling behavior

---

## Phase 4: Complete Transition

### Step 7: Clean Up Legacy Infrastructure

**Handle system components:**

- Temporarily relax PDBs  
- Drain and move system pods  
- Restore PDBs afterward

**Node cleanup tasks:**

- Delete ASG nodes  
- Remove Cluster Autoscaler  
- Clean up related AWS resources  
- Remove migration-specific taints/affinities

---

## Validation and Monitoring

### Step 8: Verify Migration Success

**What to measure:**

- Node startup time  
- CPU/memory utilization  
- Spot usage and fallback behavior  
- Infrastructure cost change

**Long-term monitoring:**

- Set alerts for scheduling/provisioning errors  
- Watch controller logs  
- Track costs and scaling patterns  
- Maintain a change log

## Best Practices and Common Pitfalls

### Best Practices

- Test thoroughly in staging  
- Migrate in phases  
- Add proper health checks  
- Use at least 2 replicas for key services  
- Monitor throughout migration

### Common Pitfalls

- Skipping resource right-sizing  
- Misconfigured or missing PDBs  
- Neglecting system components  
- Running single-replica workloads

---

## Expected Outcomes

### Performance improvements:

- 3–5 min → ~60 sec node startup  
- 2–3x better resource utilization  
- Faster and more responsive scaling

### Cost optimizations:

- 40–60% lower node costs  
- 60–80% Spot usage  
- Lower CPU/memory overhead

### Operational benefits:

- Declarative provisioning  
- Real-time optimization  
- Increased resilience and agility

## Next Steps and Advanced Configurations

**Post-migration optimization:**

- Tune provisioning configs  
- Adjust spot/on-demand weighting  
- Standardize provisioning rules

**Advanced workload strategies:**

- Use taints/tolerations for workload separation  
- Add burstable pools for spikes  
- Combine with HPA/VPA

**Scaling across environments:**

- Replicate setup across all clusters  
- Create CI pipelines for config changes  
- Build dashboards for monitoring and cost

## Conclusion

Migrating from Cluster Autoscaler to Karpenter is not just a technical upgrade — it's a strategic shift.

**Benefits:**

- 40–60% lower infra costs  
- Faster, more intelligent scaling  
- Simpler, declarative provisioning  
- Higher utilization, less waste

**Approach:**

- Optimize first
